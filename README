This software allows to import and keep tracking
the state of bugs in a remote bugzilla
by following bug mails such as
http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-bugs/
and provides a web UI to allow everyone to query the DB.

It uses mysql with indexes for speedy retrieval
and has a simplified database structure
which only tracks the current state of every bug


Install:
  debian: aptitude install libtimedate-perl libemail-simple-perl libdbi-perl libdbd-mysql-perl
  openSUSE: zypper install perl-TimeDate perl-Email-Simple perl-DBI perl-DBD-mysql


put into ~/.dbpasswd
$dbhost="YOURDBIP";
$dbuser="YOURDBUSER";
$dbpasswd="YOURDBPASSWORD";
and adjust the mysql db-name in bugzilla.pm and bugzilla.cgi


in the ~/.forward file of the receiving user, put
\YOURUSERNAME,|/path/to/mailreceiver.pl

note: if you do not want to store emails on that address,
      can omit \YOURUSERNAME, in the .forward file


Usage:
./main.pl filename.eml ...

When importing old email files it is important to list them
in chronologic order, because later updates will overwrite the state.
See import.sh for a sample call.
